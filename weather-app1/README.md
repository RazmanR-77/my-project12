# Getting Started with Create React App

**WeatherApp by author: by Razman Raman, Developer**
@RazmanR-77

Check The Current Weather with this app!

**Functions and Features**
1. **Location Input and Search Functionality**: The web app allows users to input a location (Example case, 'COUNTRYNAME') to check the weather for that specific area. There is an input field at the top with a 'Check Weather and Add+' button next to it.
 
2. **Current Weather Display**: For each location, the web app displays the current temperature in degrees Celsius (28°C), along with additional details such as sky condition (clear sky), humidity percentage (82% and 81% respectively), and wind speed (1.58 km/h).

3. **User Interface Design**: The design of the interface is clean and user-friendly, presenting essential weather information at a glance without overwhelming details, which makes it interesting for users who want quick updates.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or have any other questions! 😊


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

**NOTE:**
may run on port 5002

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
